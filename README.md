Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model for cancer diagnosis by leveraging various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify patients as cancerous or non-cancerous based on their clinical and genetic data.

Features
Logistic Regression: A robust and interpretable algorithm used to predict the likelihood of cancer. This binary classifier is particularly effective in medical diagnosis scenarios where understanding the influence of each feature is crucial.

Accuracy Score: A primary evaluation metric that measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. While providing an overall performance snapshot, it is supplemented by other metrics for a comprehensive evaluation.

Confusion Matrix: A detailed tool to visualize the performance of the classification model. It breaks down the predictions into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, facilitating the calculation of precision, recall, and F1-score.
